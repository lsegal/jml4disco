This section of the wiki provides all the information about the logical view of the key components of the JML4 Disco.

<h3 id="a2.1DistributedProgramVerification-RelevantComponents">2.1 Distributed Program Verification-Relevant Components</h3>
<p>
One of the major components of JML4 Disco is the ability to prove VCs distributively.  This section of the wiki page provides all the architecturally significant design of the JML4 Disco distributed environment.  The architecture adapted is the logical layering scheme presented by Fowler with a presentation layer, a domain logic layer and data source layer. 
</p>
<h4 id="a2.1.1High-LevelDesign">2.1.1 High-Level Design</h4>
<p>
The servers involved in Distributed Program Verification are layered as follows: in the topmost layer, the presentation layer, Java Servlets serve to marshall and demarshall the information found in Http messages passed from Client or Prover-Servers to Dispatcher. In the layer just below, the application layer, are classes relevant to the logic of distributing program verification.
Beneath the application layer is the Domain layer, which contains classes pertinent to the verification itself. The following is a simple (deliberately incomplete) diagram to convey the layers with some of the more relevant classes they contain shown, followed by a more complete, intricate class diagram.

</li></ul><h5 id="a2.1.4.2LoadBalancing">2.1.4.2 Load Balancing</h5>
<p>
Class <tt>ServerQueue</tt> object serves to encapsulate load balancing. At the moment, it inherits the implementation of a <tt>java.util.PriorityQueue</tt>, though not the interface, via delegation; an instance of <tt>ServerQueue</tt> contains instance variable <tt>queue</tt> of type <tt>java.util.PriorityQueue</tt> to which it delegates most of its method calls. <br />
The second instance variable of class <tt>ServerQueue</tt> is of type <tt>ServerComparator</tt> and is used by the <tt>java.util.PriorityQueue</tt> to ascertain the order in which <tt>AbstractRemoteServer</tt> objects should be in the queue. <br />
</p>
<h5 id="a2.1.4.3.1Inmemorycaching">2.1.4.3.1 In memory caching</h5>
<p>
The proposed implementation will keep track of two things. The first is which prover has proved a Vc. In this way, we can easily discard the Vc's that are proved by simplify, followed by those proved by CVC3, and finally the negation of the Vc proved by simplify.
</p>
<p>
The motivation for this is that we are unable to compute the amount of time it takes to prove a Vc. If we were to time a Vc on the dispatcher, we would be unable to take into account the workload and speed of the Server that the Vc was dispatched too, and thus the timing result we received would only pertain to that Vc being dispatched to that machine.
</p>
<p>
If on the other hand we were to time on the Server, we would run into the problem of synchronized clocks. There is no way to guarantee that the time returned would be accurate, since different clocks on different PC's may differ slightly. Additionally, this form of measurement would not take into account the time the Vc spent on the network being transmitted.
</p>
<p>
The second piece of information that we would keep track of is the least recently used Vc in the cache. For an analysis of why this is the caching algorithm, you can refer to the caching document. This piece of information would enable us to eliminate, when necessary, the least useful Vc in the cache, and replace it with the one that is trying to be cached.
</p>
<p>
The reason we are caching on the dispatcher, as opposed to the Provers is simple. All of the Vc's must go through the dispatcher, whereas only a subset of all Vc's go through any individual Prover. As a result, if the Vc's were to be cached on the Prover's it would be possible for a Vc to be dispatched to a Prover that did not have the Vc cached, while another server would have that information cached, and as the number of Prover's increased, the odds of a Vc being dispatched to the Prover with that Vc in the cache would decrease.
</p>
<p>
In the future, a distributed cache shared by all Prover's would merit investigation as an alternative to caching on the dispatcher.
</p>
<h5 id="a2.1.4.3.2Implementationspecificdetails">2.1.4.3.2 Implementation specific details</h5>
<p>
In order to prevent heap overflows, a cap has been put on the cache, of 1 000 000 VC's. Testing has shown that heap errors occur within the vicinity of 4 000 000 - 5 000 000 cached VC's, so 1 000 000 is a number which both affords a fair number of VC's to be cached, while at the same time taking into account the danger of heap overflows.
</p>
<p>
Once the cap of 1 000 000 VC's is reached, the caching algorithm, which is a hybrid of Least Recently Used (LRU) and priority of the VC will begin to take effect. The process will be as follows: Once 1 000 000 VC's is reached, if a new VC is proven, remove a VC from the cache that was proved with simplify, and then insert the new VC into the cache. Once all of the simplify VC's are removed, we will move onto the VC's cached with CVC3, then those VC's which were only proven as negations in simplify, and once those have been removed, we will only have VC's that were proved by isabelle in the cache. Once we have reached this step, we will only remove the LRU VC from the cache.
</p>
<p>
The JML4 core has been modified to reflect the need of the cache to know which server proved a VC. The ProveVcPiecewise class in the core has had the ProveVc method overloaded to allow this information to be communicated back to the server. The impact of this change to the core is non-existent, as all other behaviour remains the same.

Coupling has been reduced by abstracting away the logic to connect to remote Prove VC Servers into <tt>RemoteProveVcServer</tt> (an abstract class) objects. In the event that future implementations don't use TomCat / Servlet implementations, changing from one platform to another should be easier. The following is an interaction diagram representing what happens when the Thread Pool executes a <tt>ProveVcThread</tt> using a <tt>RemoteProveVcTomCatServer</tt> implementation, sending an HTTP request to a remote machine, including a Vc.

Two new features will be added to the distributed component in the form of configuration interfaces for the server machines, meant to be used by an administrator. The implementation used will be a web application, implemented using Servlets running on a Tomcat web server. As such, while the communication between remote machines during program verification may someday be able to move away from using Http to communicate, Dispatcher and Prover servers will always have to be deployed on web servers which include some Java web container, such as Apache Tomcat.

<p>
Dispatcher Server's Web-Based  Configuration Interface<br />
A layered architecture will be used to develop the configuration interface. In the very top layer, Java Server Pages will render as views, and Java Servlets will receive Http requests and interface with the layer just below, the application layer. In the application layer there will be an interface-independent implementation of a Front Controller, as well as class definitions for Command objects. Below this layer will be the existing JML4Disco classes which will be configured.
<br /><br />
Prover Server's Web-Based Configuration Interface<br />
The design proposed for the Prover Server's Configuration Interface will be identical to that of the Dispatcher's. As such, classes and types common to both implementations should be reused.

The adapters are objects that provide bridges between java jvm and theorem prover which are external processes.  The adapters deal with the actual communication with the provers' process.  In this milestone, the team has decided to change the internal behavior of SimplifyAdapter and IsabelleAdapter to avoid unnecessary creation/deletion of process every time the adapters are being called.  This change will improve significantly the performance of proving.

<p>
From the previous milestone, we were able to improve significantly the performance of proving by limiting only one process per theorem prover.  However, this does not take advantage of the full potential of multi-core systems.  Hence, during this milestone, we will aiming to generate more processes for each theorem prover (specifically for Simplify and Isabelle ESC4) in a controlled way. The following class diagram shows the changes of the Isabelle and Simplify adapters as well as new classes necessary to implement this 'process pool' concept.

<p>
Whenever, the adapter needs a process, it asks for a idle process by calling ProcessPool object's getFreeProcess() method.  Similarly, once the adapter is no longer needed for the holding process, it release it by calling releaseProcess(Process p) method.
</p>
<p>
ProcessPool object store a list of a given prover's processes.  The available processes is created on the fly (as needed) until the number of created processes hits the maximum threshold.  By default, the number of process allowed is the number of core on the host machine * 2.

<p>
<strong>Boogie: </strong><br />
The Boogie object is a compiler extension that enables the Java code to be passed through Boogie. For this to happen, there are two compiler options which must be toggled.   jmlBoogieEnabled must be enabled and  jmlEscProverStrategy must be set to "JML4BOOGIE".  Boogie's preCodeGeneration method is called by Eclipse's compilation mechanism before Java bytecode is generated for output. When the function is called, it passes down the compiler object as well as the compilation unit (the unit is the root AST node of a Java source file to parse) to the BoogieAdapter through the process function. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BoogieAdapter: </strong><br />
The Boogie adapter is responsible for instantiating a BoogieSource object (which holds boogie source). The adapter translates from java to Boogie AST by calling the BoogieVisitor visit function which will return a Boogie AST. The adapter then traverses the Boogie AST and passes the BoogieSource object to be appended by each node's <tt>toBuffer</tt> method. The adapter is then responsible for writing the source to a temporary Boogie .bpl source file and executing it through the boogie runtime. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BoogieParser (FUTURE PLAN): </strong><br />
For now, there is a parser function called parseResult which resides in the boogie adapter. Error messages (results) from Boogie, return a column and row of where the mistake has occured. The parser is responsible parsing that msg and creating a BoogieSourcePoint. With the source point, it then uses the boogieSource <tt>getTermAtPoint</tt> function to map back to a particular AST node where the error originated from. Using the AST node the parser is now able to return an error msg to the problem reporter with the nth term where it occured. In the future, the Boogie Parser should be taken out of the Boogie Adapter. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BoogieVisitor: </strong><br />
The Boogie visitor has all the node traversal methods. It uses the visitor pattern since when the the visitor's static visit method gets called by the adapter, it gets dynamically dispatched to the proper visit method. As Java AST nodes are visited, the Boogie AST is populated in the correct order. When the visitor is done visiting the JavaAST it returns the root node of the BoogieAST (aka. ProgramNode) 
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Boogie AST: </strong><br />
The BoogieAST is made up of several different types of nodes. Every Boogie node represents the equivalent syntactic element in the Boogie grammar. ex 
The statement: "var x: int" is represented by the node BoogieStatement. The nodes are generally split into the following types:
</p>
<ul><li>Expressions: Represent the equivalent expressions in the Boogie syntax.
</li><li>Statements: Represent the equivalent statements in the Boogie syntax.
</li></ul><p>
The Boogie Nodes are also responsible for appending boogie source to the BoogieSource object passed to it by the BoogieAdapter. Each node has a <tt>toBuffer</tt> method that will handle translating the node and it's children to Booge source.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BoogieSource: </strong><br />
The BoogieSource object is responsible for holding boogie source code which will in tern be written to a temporary file and passed to Boogie runtime by the adapter. The object also holds a table called boogieTable which maps BoogieSourcePoints to particular AST nodes. It is necessary to have this mapping so that when boogie returns an error message with a particular BoogieSourcePoint ( a column and a row in the boogie source) we can map backwards to a particular AST node. This mapping occurs whenever Boogie source is appended. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BoogieSourcePoint </strong><br />
A Boogie Source Point holds a row and column. It also has a compare method. It primarily used by the BoogieSource object to map points in boogie to AST nodes.

The following diagram shows the general behavior of how the Boogie compiler extension traverses the Java AST using a BoogieVisitor, translates it into a BoogieNode AST and passes the resulting Boogie source code to a Boogie runtime for processing.

<p>
Here we see how the BoogieSource object gets appended. It internally delegates to a string Buffer but also contains a map of boogiePoints to map the Java source (AST terms) to Boogie code.
