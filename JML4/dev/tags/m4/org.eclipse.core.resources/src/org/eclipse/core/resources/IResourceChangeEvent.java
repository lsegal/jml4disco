/**
 * Resource change events describe changes to resources.
 * <p>
 * There are currently five different types of resource change events:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *    Before-the-fact batch reports of arbitrary creations, 
 *    deletions and modifications to one or more resources expressed
 *    as a hierarchical resource delta. Event type is
 *    <code>PRE_BUILD</code>, and <code>getDelta</code> returns
 *    the hierarchical delta.  The resource delta is rooted at the 
 *    workspace root.  The <code>getBuildKind</code> method returns
 *    the kind of build that is about to occur, and the <code>getSource</code>
 *    method returns the scope of the build (either the workspace or a single project).
 *    These events are broadcast to interested parties immediately 
 *    before each build operation.  If autobuilding is not enabled, these events still 
 *    occur at times when autobuild would have occurred. The workspace is open 
 *    for change during notification of these events. The delta reported in this event 
 *    cycle is identical across all listeners registered for this type of event.
 *    Resource changes attempted during a <code>PRE_BUILD</code> callback
 *    <b>must</b> be done in the thread doing the notification.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    After-the-fact batch reports of arbitrary creations, 
 *    deletions and modifications to one or more resources expressed
 *    as a hierarchical resource delta. Event type is
 *    <code>POST_BUILD</code>, and <code>getDelta</code> returns
 *    the hierarchical delta. The resource delta is rooted at the 
 *    workspace root.  The <code>getBuildKind</code> method returns
 *    the kind of build that occurred, and the <code>getSource</code>
 *    method returns the scope of the build (either the workspace or a single project).
 *    These events are broadcast to interested parties at the end of every build operation.
 *    If autobuilding is not enabled, these events still occur at times when autobuild
 *    would have occurred. The workspace is open for change during notification of 
 *    these events. The delta reported in this event cycle is identical across
 *    all listeners registered for this type of event.
 *    Resource changes attempted during a <code>POST_BUILD</code> callback
 *    <b>must</b> be done in the thread doing the notification.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    After-the-fact batch reports of arbitrary creations, 
 *    deletions and modifications to one or more resources expressed
 *    as a hierarchical resource delta. Event type is
 *    <code>POST_CHANGE</code>, and <code>getDelta</code> returns
 *    the hierarchical delta. The resource delta is rooted at the 
 *    workspace root.  These events are broadcast to interested parties after
 *    a set of resource changes and happen whether or not autobuilding is enabled.  
 *    The workspace is closed for change during notification of these events.
 *    The delta reported in this event cycle is identical across all listeners registered for 
 *    this type of event.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    Before-the-fact reports of the impending closure of a single
 *    project. Event type is <code>PRE_CLOSE</code>, 
 *    and <code>getResource</code> returns the project being closed.
 *    The workspace is closed for change during  notification of these events.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    Before-the-fact reports of the impending deletion of a single
 *    project. Event type is <code>PRE_DELETE</code>, 
 *    and <code>getResource</code> returns the project being deleted.
 *    The workspace is closed for change during  notification of these events.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    Before-the-fact reports of the impending refresh of a single
 *    project. Event type is <code>PRE_REFRESH</code>, 
 *    and <code>getResource</code> returns the project being refreshed.
 *    The workspace is closed for changes during notification of these events.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In order to handle additional event types that may be introduced
 * in future releases of the platform, clients should do not write code
 * that presumes the set of event types is closed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
