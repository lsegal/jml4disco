<h2 id="a1.Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the Test Plan Document is to identify all the components of the
system that are to be tested and to describe in detail how they will be tested.
The tests of JML4 Disco are done in every iteration concurrently with the development of the source code. The objective of the testing process is to uncover as many defects in the system as possible, as soon as possible. Tests will be written using Junit. 
</p>
<h2 id="a2.TestItems">2. Test Items</h2>
<h3 id="a2.1UnitTests">2.1 Unit Tests</h3>
<p>
Developers will be responsible for writing JUnit test cases for classes and modules they write.
</p>
<h3 id="a2.2SystemLevelTests">2.2 System Level Tests</h3>
<p>
Testing of the JML4 Boogie project as a whole will be done using JUnit. The purpose and goal of these tests is to detect an failures in the implementation of the overall features of the system as a whole.
</p>
<h3 id="a2.3TestingtheBoogieComponent">2.3 Testing the Boogie Component</h3>
<p>
Testing of the Boogie component in the JML4 Disco project was divided into two major test suites: the translation of Java to Boogie and the running of translated Boogie code in the Boogie runtime (referred to as the Boogie adapter). This was done in order to allow for more fine-grained testing instead of large black box components. Using this strategy, failure scenarios can be interpreted as a failure to translate Java code into Boogie, or a failure to send or parse data to and from the Boogie adapter, the two major sub-components of the Boogie architecture.
</p>
<h4 id="a2.3.1JavatoBoogieTranslation">2.3.1 Java to Boogie Translation</h4>
<p>
In order to test the translation of Java code into Boogie code, test cases are handwritten and manually verified as valid syntax in a Boogie runtime. Once the expected result is syntactically valid, the test case is written and the translation is implemented to match the expected syntax. This guarantees correctness of syntax according to the Boogie runtime.
</p>
<h4 id="a2.3.2TestingThroughBoogieRuntime">2.3.2 Testing Through Boogie Runtime</h4>
<p>
If translation succeeds and syntax is valid, semantic testing must be done in order to ensure that the translated Boogie code performs the right task. This is done again by handwriting tests for each subcomponent which are manually verified for correctness in a Boogie runtime. Once this is done, the expected results are matched up against the results from the Boogie runtime and implementation is done to ensure everything works.
</p>
<h4 id="a2.3.3TraceabilitytoFeatures">2.3.3 Traceability to Features</h4>
<p>
The <a href="/trac/wiki/BoogieTraceability" class="wiki">BoogieTraceability</a> document shows progress of each subfeature in the Boogie component. Each subfeature traces to the specific tests in both translation and runtime testing and their latest pass or fail state. This traceability matrix is maintained by a Ruby script located at <a href="/trac/browser/JML4/dev/trunk/scripts/export-boogie-traceability.rb" class="source">source:/JML4/dev/trunk/scripts/export-boogie-traceability.rb</a> which parses metadata from the Java source files.
</p>
<h3 id="a2.5TestingofDistributedDispatchingofVCs">2.5 Testing of Distributed Dispatching of VCs</h3>
<p>
Tests start as soon as first design decisions are made. Since time and resources are
limited, testing will be delimited by the requirements baseline.
</p>
<h2 id="a3.TestingStrategies">3. Testing Strategies</h2>
<h3 id="a3.1TestDrivenDesignTDD">3.1 Test Driven Design (TDD)</h3>
<p>
One of the requirements of the project is to translate the Java source into Boogie so that it can then be tested for correctness. To do so, Test Driven Design (TDD) will be used. JUnit tests will be created before implementation which will compare Java Source code against the Boogie code it should be translated into. After this is done, implementation to match the correct expected value will be performed until the test passes (see diagram below).

</p>
<h2 id="a4.QualityAssurance">4. Quality Assurance</h2>
<h3 id="a4.1TestEntryCriteria">4.1 Test Entry Criteria</h3>
<p>
For tests supporting the Boogie implementation, TDD is used. As such, test entry begins as soon as the requirements for the component have been acquired and understood. For implementation of other tests, entry begins after implementation of the components.
</p>
<h3 id="a4.2TestSuiteExitCriteria">4.2 Test Suite Exit Criteria</h3>
<p>
The test suite is considered to be complete once all tests have passed successfully.
</p>
<h3 id="a4.3SuspensionandResumptionCriteria">4.3 Suspension and Resumption Criteria</h3>
<p>
A test suite may be suspended if there are not enough resources to be devoted to it.
