<P>
This document describes an implementation of JML and related tools in an 
Eclipse plug-in.
The plug-in is based on the JML4 work of extending Eclipse's JDT compiler and 
UI infrastructure.
The ideal goal is to have this plug-in be a pure Eclipse plug-in; 
however, this has not been possible - the JDT does not export all of the 
functionality needed to extend it, and so some internal modification has been 
necessary.  Nevertheless, the plug-in can be installed and used as a 
conventional Eclipse plug-in.
</P><P>
The JML-ESC plug-in provides the following capabilities, described in more
detail later in this document:
<UL>
<LI>syntax checking of JML comments</LI>
<LI>execution of JML specifications as runtime checks</LI>
<LI>static comparison of code and JML specifications using embedded provers</LI>
<LI>integration of these capabilities as familiar UI elements within the Java
development environment of Eclipse</LI>
<LI>a .jar file, separate from the plug-in, that provides a standalone
compiler incorporating both the run-time and static checking, similar to the
command-line version of the Eclipse JDT compiler.</LI>
</UL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="Installation">Installation</A></H2>
The JML-ESC plug-in feature) is installed via a conventional 
Eclipse update site, located at TBD.  The feature consists of two plugins,
one is a replacement for org.eclipse.jdt.core and the other is a new plugin
containing JML and ESC capability.  Installation is accomplished with the
following steps:
<UL>
<LI>Select Help->Software Updates->Find and install from the Eclipse menu</LI>
<LI>Select "Search for new features to install", and "Next"</LI>
<LI> ... add new remote site</LI>
<LI> ... TBD</LI>
</UL>

JML and ESC functionality is not on be default.  You need to enable options
on the JML preference page (under Java) and you may need to enable JML and
ESC in the filter settings of the Problems View.
<P/>
Since the JML-ESC plug-in includes a modified version of an Eclipse plug-in, a
particular version of the JML-ESC plug-in will only work with a particular
version of Eclipse. 
<P/>
The standalone compiler can be downloaded from TBD.


<H2><A NAME="JML">The Java Modeling Language</A></H2>
<P>
The Java Modeling Language 
[see <A href="http://www.jmlspecs.org">www.jmlspecs.org</A> and the
references listed there]
is a language for annotating Java programs with specifications describing
the behavior of classes and methods.  The annotations are contained in 
specially formatted comments; thus they are ignored by conventional Java compilers.
Various tools are available for checking, either statically or at run-time,
 that the specifications and the code agree (that is, that the specifications
 describe what the code does or the code implements what the specifications 
 require, depending on your point of view).
 </P><P>
 The syntax and semantics of JML are described in the JML reference manual [link or reference needed TBD].
 </P><P>
 JML is a collaborative research endeavor (and therefore subject to ongoing 
 improvement and experimentation), started by 
 <A href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~leavens/homepage.html">Gary Leavens</A>,
 but now involving many groups.
 </P>
 
 
 
 
<H2><A NAME="Status">Features and Status</A></H2>
The JML-ESC plugin implements (or intends to implement) the following features.
<H3>Core functionality</H3>
<UL>

<LI>JML syntax checking integrated into the JDT parser.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>A small amount of JML is implemented, enough to show that
the infrastructure works.  The JML checking happens whenever a file is recompiled,
so it can be performed automatically or manually, just as compilation can be.
Note that the intention is that as much as possible of the JDT parser be reused,
if that can be done in an extensible and modular fashion.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Complete implementation of the JML language.
</LI><P/>

<LI>JML syntax and typechecking errors shown while editing
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Java syntax and typechecking errors are shown while editing,
without needing to save a file.  JML should be treated the same way.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Check or implement this.
</LI><P/>


<LI>ESC static checking integrated into the parser.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>ESC/Java2 is wrapped into the plug-in.  It is executed on
a compilation unit when the compilation unit is compiled, whether manually or
automatically.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>An integration of ESC into the JDT.  Currently all the parsing
and checking for ESC is done by Escjava (that is the work of parsing and
typechecking is duplicated), rather than
using the JDT's compiler. 
</LI><P/>

<LI>Incremental checking integrated into Eclipse
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not yet started
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>This requires being able to run just the minimum number of
rechecks after a series of editing changes.  It requires knowing which other compilation
units depend on a given source file, so that when that source file is edited,
just the right other files are checked.  (Imagine what needs to happen if a
specification file is changed).
</LI><P/>

<LI>Run-time assertion checking integrated into the plug-in. 
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Some RAC has been incorporated into the JDT compiler; violated
checks appear as exceptions.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Fuller implementation of RAC as the implementation of JML is
expanded.  Integration of RAC with the debugger.  Integration of RAC with the
incremental compiler (appropriate recompilation needs to happen if a spec file
changes).  We also want to be able to log and continue after an assertion violation.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Command-line compilation and checking
<BR/><B>Status: </B>It has been demonstrated that a command-line tool can be
created and run, analogous to the ecj.jar file containing the JDT batch
compiler.  The tool has an acceptable startup time.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>To build the requisite jar file as part of the build process,
provide appropriate JUnit tests, a place to download it, and directions for its
use.  There are lots of command-line options to be implemented.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Generation of Javadocs with JML content (jmldoc).
<BR/><B>Status/Needed: </B>Not started.  Might not be achievable since I think that 
Eclipse simply uses an external tool for generating jmldoc.  We might be able to
generate jmldoc ourselves from the ASTs, but that would be counter to the
philosophy of not duplicating existing infrastructure.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Auto-generation of empty spec files.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not started.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>This can likely be accomplished with current Eclipse capabilities.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Auto-generation of specifications.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not started.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Some of this can be done (e.g. getters and setters) 
straightforwardly.  More generally, this might require integrating Houdini or
an equivalent tool (which is not within any planning horizon).
</LI><P/>

<LI>Calvin multi-thread checking integrated into the tool
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Completely in the future.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Daikon specification mining integrated into the tool.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Completely in the future, and likely to be wrapped rather than
explicitly integrated.
</LI><P/>


</UL>
<H3>Administration</H3>
<UL>


<LI>Testing
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Started but needs lots of work
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>A much more comprehensive set of tests on the JML and RAC and
ESC functionality, integrated as JUnit tests within the Eclipse IDE.  
One difficulty is creating a means of testing the UI functionality.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Developer tips
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Some stuff on the 
<A href="http://jmlspecs.wiki.sourceforge.net/JML4+Repository">JML-reloaded wiki</A>
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Instructions to setup and use a development environment; instructions
to add to and run tests; instructions to make a release; instruction to report and
resolve bugs.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Issues/Bugs reporting and resolving
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Non-existent
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Need a structure for reporting and resolving bugs and issues.
</LI><P/>



<LI>A plug-in update site and location for the batch compiler.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>The procedure for building an update site is implemented.
The batch compiler has been created and executed manually.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Deciding on the location of the update site; deciding
procedures for handling version numbers; creating an automatic procedure for
building the batch compiler.
</LI><P/>

<LI>PR
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not yet
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Advertising of the new update site and tools on the JML
and other relevant web sites.
</LI><P/>

</UL>
<H3>UI features</H3>
<UL>

<LI>Console
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Complete. The UI plug-in creates a new Console that captures any 
textual output that goes to System.out or System.err.  Without this console,
such text goes variously to the invoking shell, the invoking Eclipse application,
or into thin air.  This is normally to be used for logging and debugging 
information, rather than information important to the user.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Integration of RAC with the debugger
<BR/><B>Status: </B>No integration yet.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Being able to stop on various kinds of assertion errors;
being able to evaluate specifications at various points; be able to see the
values of ghost or model variables 
</LI><P/>


<LI>JML syntax errors are reported 
through the problems view and problem markers and squiggly underlining in the editor.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>
Problems are reported via the problems view, problem markers in the editor, and
red squiggly underlining in the text.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Integration of
a marker type that distinguishes JML errors from Java errors (currently the markers
are the same); the underlining
is not always in the correct position. Errors found in a different file than the
one being compiled (e.g. specification files) need to be reported in 
the correct editor.
</LI><P/>


<LI>ESC syntax errors are reported 
through the problems view and problem markers and squiggly underlining in the editor.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>
Problems are reported via the problems view, ESC-specific problem markers in 
the editor, and red squiggly underlining in the text.  The ESC problem markers 
are orange with a superimposed E.  Furthermore the markers are appropriately
deleted, whether during an explicit clean of a project or prior to a build of
a project or a specific file within a project.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>The underlining
is not always in the correct position. Errors found in a different file than the
one being compiled (e.g. specification files) need to be reported in 
the correct editor.  Some policy or UI choice needs to be put in place to control
which marker (the red or the orange) one is used for ESC warnings.  The problems
view does not yet use the special markers.  ESC markers are not on by default in
the Problems view (must be enabled through the filters view).
</LI><P/>

<LI>Navigation to associated declarations 
<BR/><B>Status: </B>
Not begun
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>ESC warnings often have an associated declaration (e.g. the
line in the specification that a particular statement in the code violates).
There needs to be a way within the UI to easily open an editor for the file
containing the associated declaration at the appropriate line.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Editing of specification files 
<BR/><B>Status: </B> Specification files (denoted by a jml or spec suffix) open
into a Java editor and are identified by a JML icon in the Package Explorer View
and the Navigator View.
Not begun
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>The icon on the editor for specification files changes.
Sometimes it is a JML icon, but when when a file is opened again it has a different
icon.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Menubar items
<BR/><B>Status: </B>There is a menubar item named 'JML' from which one can 
select various menu items.  So far it has these menu items:
<UL>
<LI><B>Clear ESC markers</B>: this manually clears all ESC markers from the currently selected
editor or Java element</LI>
<LI><B>Run static checks</B>: manually runs ESC on the currently 
selected editor window or Java element(s)</LI>
<LI><B>Go to associated specification</B>: opens an editor at the specification referred to 
by the marker on the line containing the selection</LI>
</UL>
<B>Needed: </B>More menu items?  Note - currently you have to have a selection in
the editor window for the 'Go to' command to work.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Toolbar items
<BR/><B>Status: </B>There are two toolbar contributions.  One is identified by the yellow
JML coffee cup as its icon; the effect of activating this item is the same
as the "Run static checks" menu item.  The other is the yellow coffee cup with 
a red circle and diagonal slash (meaning NO); the effect of this item is the 
same as the "Clear ESC markers" menu item.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Anything else? 
</LI><P/>

<LI>Context menu items (Package Explorer)
<BR/><B>Status: </B>These are menu items that are available when you right-click
on an element of a view (works in Package Explorer, Project Explorer, Outline views). 
There are context menu items corresponding to the Clear
and Run menubar items.  Their effects are the same, except that they apply to
the item right-clicked upon rather than whatever editor is selected.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Any others? Run not yet implemented.  Items are not visible in Navigator view.
Some other options: Enable/Disable RAC; Enable/Disable ESC.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Context menu items (Problem View)
<BR/><B>Status: </B>These are menu items that are available when you right-click
on an element of a view.  The problem view has a 'Go to associated specification'
menu item that performs that operation for the marker right-clicked upon.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>The context menu item ought to appear only when it is on an
ESC problem.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Context menu items (Marker ruler on editor window)
<BR/><B>Status: </B>These are menu items that are available when you right-click
on an element of a view.  The 'Go to associated specification' menu item performs
that operation for the marker on the line of the currently selected text.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Any others? This ought to apply to the marker right-clicked 
upon, but have not been able to get that to work.
</LI><P/>

<LI>New Specification File Wizard
<BR/><B>Status: </B>There is a menu entry under 'New' for a new specification file.
It pops up a wizard, but the implementation is very much in progress.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>COMplete this, both for the case of matching a spec to an
existing type and for creating a whole new file (do we need the latter?).
</LI><P/>

<LI>Commands and Key bindings
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Complete. There are Eclipse commands defined for various JML-ESC actions.
This allows key bindings to be attached to the commands using the 
Window->Preferences->General->Keys preferences page.  The command category is
named 'JML-ESC'; there are two commands currently defined, corresponding to
Clear Markers and Run ESC.  These have the same effect as the corresponding 
menubar and toolbar items.  No key bindings are defined by default.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>New commands for any new menu items, e.g. Enable/Disable RAC or ESC
</LI><P/>

<LI>Syntax coloring of JML comments
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not begun.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>To enable JML comments to have syntax coloring like Java
code does.  This will need extensions to Eclipse's internals (at least it did 
when the KSU group tried it); those extensions need to be done in a way that 
makes possible other such enhancements in the future.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Decorators on project or file names to indicate whether they are enabled for
RAC or ESC checking.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not yet started
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>All of these.  Note there is a UI design decision to be made.
Currently all the preferences, including whether JML and ESC are enabled, apply
to either every project in the workspace, or one can have a complete set of 
project specific preferences.  It may be better to separate the JML/ESC enablement
from the rest of the preferences, so that we can allow JML or ESC to be enabled
on a per project and per file basis, without needing to make all other preferences
be project-specific.
</LI><P/>


<LI>Viewing of the intermediate Boogie representation, verification conditions,
counterexamples
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not yet started
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>All of these
</LI><P/>

<LI>Preference pages
<BR/><B>Status: </B>There is a standard JML-ESC preferences page 
(under Window->Preferences->Java->JML), with a rudimentary set of 
preferences.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>Fill out the preferences with the needed options for JML checking, RAC and ESC
</LI><P/>


<LI>Help pages through the Eclipse help menu
<BR/><B>Status: </B>The Eclipse plug-in extension to create a Help document is complete.
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>The content
of the help page (this document) is incomplete.  Among other things it needs
installation instructions and quick start instructions.
Also, clicking on the JML-ESC topic in the main help menu produces a page
with a table of contents; it would be better if it showed the documentation page.
</LI><P/>

<LI>Integration of semantic information: having the search for references, 
declarations, implementors, read and write access work for syntactic entities
(e.g. type names) that are in JML specifications, like they do in Java code.
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not yet started
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>All of these
</LI><P/>

<LI>Various other things not yet started: quick fixes, tips and tricks, cheat
sheets, formatting and indentation of JML comments, F1 help, hover help, 
tooltips, templates for adding JML specs to classes and methods
<BR/><B>Status: </B>Not yet started
<BR/><B>Needed: </B>All of these
</LI><P/>


</UL>
<H2>Architecture and Design issues</H2>

Most of the features above are straightforward applications of the Eclipse
extension mechanisms to provide new features for the user.  This section 
describes some of the design decisions that caused modifications to the Eclipse
code itself. 

Remember that wherever there are changes needed to Eclipse itself, it is the
goal of this project to make those changes in a way that provides a generic
extension mechanism.  That has not been achieved in all of these cases.  Comments
on this point are made for each design category below.  [We would also like the
generic extension mechanisms, or something like them, to be adopted into Eclipse.]
