<p>
In this milestone we managed to finally setup our workspace. There are still some minor issues but all in all, I think we will be ready implement some of our plans in M3. We hit many bumps with our installation of provers and of the environment. The operating system on which our computers would run had bugs, the eclipse environment would not run, and problems occurred during the installation of the provers as well. There were also issues with the network drive disk quota not only in terms of memory but with the # of files as well and we are still faced with those same issues with our allocated machine. We also faced issues in terms of connectivity as we have no internet for the computers allocated to us. Last but not least, we managed to install TPTP, a profiling tool for Java which runs within Eclipse. This Milestone was really dedicated to exploring what our options are and setting up the workspace with the tools that were provided to us. We have also switched Management from Richard to Carl. Second in command will remain Leveda.
