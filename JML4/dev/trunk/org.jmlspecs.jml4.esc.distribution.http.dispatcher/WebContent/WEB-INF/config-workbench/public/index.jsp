Welcome to the  Distributed Program Verification Dispatcher Configuration workbench.<br>
From this workbench you can configure all essential behavior of the Dispatching Server.<br>
Currently this consists of adding and removing servers, specifying the Dispatcher's throttling values, <br>
enabling and disabling caching, and, of course, specifying the maximum number of request to be handled in parallel.
