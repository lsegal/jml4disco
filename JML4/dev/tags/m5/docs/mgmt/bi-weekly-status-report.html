<h2 id="Milestone5:">Milestone 5:</h2>
<h3 id="ManagerSummary">Manager Summary</h3>
<p>
There have been several problems with the system Tests made available to the developers of the Distribution component, and after encountering and documenting inconsistent behavior concretely, we confronted our primary stakeholder about these problems. After some time and help, we were finally able to discover that the integration of the original Esc4Web prototype with the core code had resulted in a test class (<tt>ProverStrategy_Timings</tt>) was being used in the place of a proper implementation (<tt>ProverStrategy</tt>) and was causing both significant performance slowdowns, as well as invalid results.
Despite attempts last milestone to improve load balancing techniques, the Distribution component developers have hit a roadblock in that performance is too fast for the current tests. As such, even when the load balancing fails, performance does not seem to suffer.
</p>
<p>
There have also been some issues with the Boogie development that have been addressed and tackled. Boogie only allows for variables to be declared at the top of the procedure. Take for instance the following simple method A() in java:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">public void A() {
	int x;
	x = 3+1;
        int y = x;	
}
 
</pre><p>
We  need to have variables <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> declared at the very top of the boogie procedure before being used in the code. The code would translate to the following boogie:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">procedure A() {
	var x : int;
	var y : int;
	x := 3+1;
	y := x;
}
</pre><p>
This in turn creates a <strong>second problem</strong>, because we cannot just insert into an existing boogie because of the existing <strong> mapping</strong> we have from java to boogie. Our solution was to create a special visitor which is called by the method declaration visitor which will do a first-pass on the method and delcare the variables at the top before translating the rest of the method to boogie. 
We have also fixed the issue of local variables. Variables names in java will first be stored in a <strong>symbol table</strong> and will be appended accordingly before going to boogie.  The  BoogieSymbolTable class is used to map all local variable declarations to unique, scope independent symbol names.

<h3 id="ManagerSummary1">Manager Summary</h3>
<p>
It is safe to say that in Milestone 4, progress has finally been made. Performance has greatly been improved through our ability to improve the implementation of the Isabelle adapter. Improvements have also been made in coming up with a load balancing strategy for the distributed discharging of VCs although timing tests will have to be done early in the next milestone to determine whether these changes are actually necessary. Boogie has also been effectively plugged in the system as a prover and a boogie strategy is on it's way of being developed. Tests for checking for the validity of our translations from AST to Boogie will continue concurrently with adapter tests ensuring that boogie does in fact return the expected results. In the next milestone, we will look into detail on how to handle the results given from boogie. We will also look into other facets of the UI such as a web configuration interface for the prover servers, and handling compiler settings within the eclipse IDE. The team manager remains Carl whereas the decision has been made for Richard will be taking on the role of sub-team leader for the distributed team as of Milestone 5.
</p>
<p>
The Second Prototype which was developed in Milestone 3 will not be continued for Milestone 4. It has been discovered to bug-ridden, and the design is not adequately encapsulated for it to be really scalable/maintainable. We have, however, learned a little more about the limitations and requirements of the underlying technologies we are using for distributed program verification. Part of the paradigm we were using was the idea of the Dispatcher keeping queues of Vcs to be sent to remote machines. This concept, however, proved to either not contribute significantly, or - in some experimental implementations - was in fact a significant slow down, since a <a href="/trac/wiki/TomCat" class="missing wiki" rel="nofollow">TomCat?</a> server is always ready to accept more requests.

<h3 id="ManagerSummary2">Manager Summary</h3>
<p>
With the final issues with the workspaces resolved we began implementation and testing in this milestone. We have decided to split the team into two sub groups. One group lead by Nicholas is in charge of the implementation and the documentation of distributed strategies. The other sub-group began working with Boogie. We are using TDD to achieve our goal of translating JML4 decorated Java to Boogie. We have begun writing tests which test the validity of these translations as well as the implementations in the code that they test. On the distributed end, we have begun a basic load balancing strategy to accelerate proving times over a network of servers. The team manager remains Carl, with Leveda as second in command. Nicholas was also appointed sub-team leader for the distributed team.

<p>
In this milestone we managed to finally setup our workspace. There are still some minor issues but all in all, I think we will be ready implement some of our plans in M3. We hit many bumps with our installation of provers and of the environment. The operating system on which our computers would run had bugs, the eclipse environment would not run, and problems occurred during the installation of the provers as well. There were also issues with the network drive disk quota not only in terms of memory but with the # of files as well and we are still faced with those same issues with our allocated machine. We also faced issues in terms of connectivity as we have no internet for the computers allocated to us. Last but not least, we managed to install TPTP, a profiling tool for Java which runs within Eclipse. This Milestone was really dedicated to exploring what our options are and setting up the workspace with the tools that were provided to us. We have also switched Management from Richard to Carl. Second in command will remain Leveda.
