<p>
The purpose of the Test Plan Document is to identify all the components of the
system that are to be tested and to describe in detail how they will be tested.
The tests of JML4 Disco are done in every iteration concurrently with the development of the source code. The objective of the testing
process is to uncover as many defects in the system as possible, as soon as possible. Tests
will be written using Junit.

<p>
Developers will be responsible for writing JUnit test cases for classes and
modules they write.

<blockquote>
<p>
Testing of the JML4 Boogie project as a whole will be done using JUnit. The purpose and goal of these tests is to detect an failures in the implementation of the overall features of the system as a whole.

<p>
One of the requirements of our project is to translate the Java source into Boogie so that it can then be tested for correctness. To do so we will testing each
We will be implementing the translation of the AST to Boogie through TDD (Test Driven Design).We will be creating JUnit tests first which compare Java Source code against the Boogie code it should be translated into. After this is done we will focus on making the necessary changes to the code so that the particular test passes. (See Diagram)

The following traceability shows our progress of the this feature through the tests that have passed. We are mapping tests to each type of node being traversed through the AST to ensure that translation is being done properly.

Tests start as soon as first design decisions are made. Since time and resources are
limited, testing will be delimited by the requirements baseline.
