<strong>Project</strong>: New static verification strategy for JML4<br />
<strong>Client</strong>: Dependable Software Research Group(DSRG) - This group includes: Patrice Chalin, Perry James, George Karabotsos.
</p>
<p>
We'd be working with the DSRG to expand the JML4 project to include static verification of JML annotated Java programs using "Boogie".  Boogie being a static program verifier for object oriented programs developped by microsoft.
This project would entail translating the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into BoogiePL. The BoogiePL would in turn be passed to Boogie for further parsing and verification. Once Boogie is integrated as a proving strategy within JML4, stratic cheking times will be reduced and the process optimized through distributed and parallel verification.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore here are some other avenues which can be explored as part of a JML4 expansion, as mentioned by the client
</p>
<ul><li>There is a tool called JmlUnit that could be ported to the JML4 framework as well. This tool automatically generates a test oracle from the JML specs of a Java class.
</li><li>Adapt Eclipse's refactoring to support the refactoring of specifications.
</li><li>Automated generation of code from specifications.
</li><li>Model Driven Design + JML --&gt; code.
</li><li>Use specs to optimize the compiler code.
</li></ul></div>
