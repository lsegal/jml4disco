<h3 id="a1.1Purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>
This document is concerned with identifying risks and drawing up plans to minimize their effect on our contribution to the JML4Disco project.
These risks will be divided into six categories:
</p>
<ul><li>Technology Risks - any risks which stem from the technology needed for the project - especially pertinent to platform - are Technology Risks.
</li><li>People Risks - People Risks pertain to team member competence, training and expertise.
</li><li>Organizational Risks - Schedule, resource constraints, budget process and other management-relevant risks are referred to as Organizational Risks.
</li><li>Tool Risks - Some commercial products will be used during the course of the project - be they directly integrated in the system or use by the developers - and with them come Tool Risks.
</li><li>Requirements Risks - Any risks which stem from failings in either the communication between the client and the project team or the early inception/elaboration phases are Requirements Risks.
</li><li>Estimation Risks - Risks which can result from errors in metrics - be it effort estimation on an activity, or the size/cost of a component - are Estimation Risks
</li></ul><h3 id="a1.2SystemOverview">1.2 System Overview</h3>
<p>
The Java Modeling Language (JML) is the most popular Behavioral Interface Specification Language (BISL) for Java. JML4Disco is an Eclipse-based Integrated development and Verification Environment (IVE) for Java and JML. [1]
</p>
<h3 id="a1.3ScopeoftheRiskManagementDocument">1.3 Scope of the Risk Management Document</h3>
<p>
JML4Disco is an extensive project, but this document is relevant to the addition of the following features of JML4Disco:
</p>
<ul><li>Improved performance, via distributed VC proving.
</li><li>Generating Boogie code from the JML4-enhanced Eclipse AST.
</li><li>The development of JML4-compatible tool to auto-generate JUnit tests from JML4 syntax, 'JMLUnit.'

<h4 id="a4.1.1Computerresourcesmadeavailabletotheteammaybeinadequateandthusmaydelaydevelopment">4.1.1 Computer resources made available to the team may be inadequate and thus may delay development</h4>
<p>
The JML4Disco project requires significant resources; more than are available to standard Concordia ENCS student accounts made available to all team members.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>Size and complexity of the JML4Disco project.
</li><li>Inadequate computer resources made available to the team.
<ul><li>Significant disk space is needed.
</li><li>A newer version of the Eclipse IDE then that available in the ENCS labs is needed.
</li></ul></li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
Without an adequate environment in which to perform development, the project will not get underway and will be impossible to complete. This is a top priority and must be addressed as early in the project as possible. <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Catastrophic.
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>Group Network Drive</strong>:
A group space on the Concordia network could be used to make additional disk space available to the team, where they would deploy both the newer version of Eclipse needed for development as well as the JML4Disco project itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>User-Managed Machines</strong>:
If the team could also get access to user-managed machines/servers to work with, this would provide them with unrestricted access and control to the full resources of those machines, as opposed to being restricted to the network quotas of ENCS student accounts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The DSRG Lab</strong>:
It is also possible that the team receive access to machines in the DSRG lab, which would already have the appropriate version of Eclipse installed, as well as already have the JML4Disco project ready for development.
</p>
<h3 id="a4.2PeopleRisks">4.2 People Risks</h3>
<h4 id="a4.2.1InadequateteammemberexpertisemayresultinconsiderabledelaysintheinstallationandconfigurationoftheJMLdevelopmentenvironment">4.2.1 Inadequate team member expertise may result in considerable delays in the installation and configuration of the JML development environment</h4>
<p>
Team members are not familiar with the initial setup of the development environment for the JML4Disco project, which is complex. Figuring out how to do it may result in considerable delays. Reproducing the process several times may result in further delays, and will also significantly increase the impact of any problems which require the re-deployment of the environment.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors1">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>JML4 expertise and familiarity of team members is too low.
</li><li>Incomplete documentation of installation and configuration of initial development environment.
</li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity1">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
If we cannot complete the installation and configuration in a timely manner - since a significant part of this project relies on benchmarking the existing code and comparing the results with prototypes - this will delay the project, as well as make it potentially impossible for us to contribute to it. <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Critical.
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures1">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>A JML4 expert could be brought in to consult on the environment setup</strong>:
During the initial installation and setup, we could bring in a representative of the DSRG who is more familiar with the setup of JML4 to guide us through the process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Documentation of the initial installation and setup</strong>:
During the initial setup and installation of development environments, we could produce a very details I&amp;C document entailing the necessary steps in the setup.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Creation of I&amp;C scripts</strong>:
Shell scripts could be created to automate the installation and setup process.
</p>
<h4 id="a4.2.2Inceptionphasemaytakelongerthanestimatedduetoteammemberslackofexperiencecontributingtoexistingproject">4.2.2 Inception phase may take longer than estimated due to team member's lack of experience contributing to existing project</h4>
<p>
Team members are - for the most part - students who have always begun the development and inception of a system themselves. As such the team's vision and direction for the project - especially when considering the three fairly distinct features our team is to contribute - can become 
</p>
<p>
ambiguous.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors2">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>Heavy-weight, non-cohesive features are easy to perceive as distinct projects.
</li><li>Team member inexperience.
</li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity2">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
A clear vision is vital for a team to make best use of the inception and elaboration phase, and re-defining it later in the project can be costly. <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Catastrophic.
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures2">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>Clearly identify in a Vision Document that we are contributing major features to the JML4Disco project</strong>:
The vision document serves to identify the needs of the stakeholders, and the features of the system. By clearly identifying the stakeholders as those of the JML4 system, and the project as a new project which stands upon the work done for JML4 thus far, the goal and direction of the project remains clear.
</p>
<h3 id="a4.3ToolRisks">4.3 Tool Risks</h3>
<h4 id="a4.3.1Considerableresourcesmaybeinvestedonlytodeterminethatoff-the-shelfcachingsoftwareisunabletodeliverthehigh-speedperformancerequiredofthesystem">4.3.1 Considerable resources may be invested only to determine that off-the-shelf caching software is unable to deliver the high-speed performance required of the system</h4>
<p>
Caching is not something the team members are familiar with and thus it is most likely better to use an available caching solution than develop one in-house.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors3">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>Expertise and familiarity with caching tools is low among team members.
</li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity3">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
Given our unfamiliarity with caching, if we select to use an off-the-shelf product which does not suit our needs, there will be considerable delays in learning the intricacies of a new tool, and even more if it turns out that no tools suit the project's needs and a caching solution has to be developed in-house. <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Critical.
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures3">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>Prototyping</strong>:
Preliminary prototypes could be developed at inception and elaboration phases of the project to both determine and demonstrate the potential of different caching tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of adapters to reduce coupling between JML4Disco and the implemented caching tool</strong>:
Steps can taken in adding caching to JML4Disco, so as to provide an adapter or facade which allows one caching implementation (or tool) to easily be switched with another so as to reduce the impact on the rest of the project in the event that a selected caching tool cannot perform as well as expected.
</p>
<h3 id="a4.4OrganizationalRisks">4.4 Organizational Risks</h3>
<p>
No organizational risks at the moment.
</p>
<h3 id="a4.5RequirementsRisks">4.5 Requirements Risks</h3>
<h4 id="a4.5.1Changestorequirementswhichresultinmajordesignreworkmaybeproposedbasedonearlyresults">4.5.1 Changes to requirements which result in major design rework may be proposed based on early results</h4>
<p>
The project - in particular features pertinent to improved performance via distribution - involves a certain degree of experimentation and prototyping. As such requirements may be very fluid based on test results.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors4">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>Poor understanding of initial project description.
</li><li>Poor understanding of problem domain and project goal.
</li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity4">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
The team management will have to ensure that the project does not get rushed into making and taking significant design and implementation decisions before all relevant prototyping and testing has been done, lest the invested time and resources spent on a particular implementation be wasted and lost. <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Critical
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures4">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>Prototyping</strong>:
Preliminary prototypes could be developed at inception and elaboration phases of the project before major design and implementation decisions are taken so as to minimize the impact this risk could have on the project.
</p>
<h4 id="a3.5.2ConsiderableresourcesmaybeinvestedonlytodeterminecachingmaynotbebeneficialtotheperformanceofJML4Disco">3.5.2 Considerable resources may be invested only to determine caching may not be beneficial to the performance of JML4Disco</h4>
<p>
One of the high-value features pertinent to the improved performance via distributed VC proving is caching of VC results.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors5">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>Expertise and familiarity with caching is low among team members.
</li><li>Complexity of VCs makes it difficult to choose the method of removal and addition of elements to cache.
</li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity5">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
Despite the fact that caching is a high-value feature specifically requested by the customer, there is nothing yet to assure us that it will constitute to the end-goal of improving performance of JML4Disco, and the time and resources invested may be wasted and lost.  <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Marginal
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures5">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>Prototyping</strong>:
Preliminary prototypes could be developed at inception and elaboration phases of the project to both determine and demonstrate the potential of different caching strategies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Risk acceptance</strong>:
Since caching is one of the high-value features expected by the client, part of the project is to determine if

<h3 id="a4.5EstimationRisks">4.5 Estimation Risks</h3>
<h4 id="a4.5.1Effortestimationsmaybeoffduetomanagementinexperienceresultingindelays">4.5.1 Effort estimations may be off due to management inexperience, resulting in delays</h4>
<p>
The team is comprised of students with minimal experience in terms of effort estimation. If estimations are off for critical activities the project may go behind schedule.
</p>
<h5 id="PossibleContributingFactors6">Possible Contributing Factors</h5>
<ul><li>Team member inexperience in management of projects
</li><li>Changes in management
</li></ul><h5 id="RiskImpactandSeverity6">Risk Impact and Severity</h5>
<p>
Errors in effort estimation may well result in the project being delayed overall, and - since the final deadline to deliver is not set so much by the client as by the course/semester - such overall project delays can be costly to the successful completion of the project. <br />
<strong>Severity</strong>: Critical
</p>
<h5 id="PotentialCounter-Measures6">Potential Counter-Measures</h5>
<p>
<strong>Research similar projects to create a relatively accurate model for activity planning</strong>:
Researching similar projects could potentially reveal strategies for effort estimation which are particularly valid for a project of this nature.
