<h3 id="ManagerSummary">Manager Summary</h3>
<p>
With the final issues with the workspaces resolved we began implementation and testing in this milestone. We have decided to split the team into two sub groups. One group lead by Nicholas is in charge of the implementation and the documentation of distributed strategies. The other sub-group began working with Boogie. We are using TDD to achieve our goal of translating JML4 decorated Java to Boogie. We have begun writing tests which test the validity of these translations as well as the implementations in the code that they test. On the distributed end, we have begun a basic load balancing strategy to accelerate proving times over a network of servers. The team manager remains Carl, with Leveda as second in command. Nicholas was also appointed sub-team leader for the distributed team.

<p>
In this milestone we managed to finally setup our workspace. There are still some minor issues but all in all, I think we will be ready implement some of our plans in M3. We hit many bumps with our installation of provers and of the environment. The operating system on which our computers would run had bugs, the eclipse environment would not run, and problems occurred during the installation of the provers as well. There were also issues with the network drive disk quota not only in terms of memory but with the # of files as well and we are still faced with those same issues with our allocated machine. We also faced issues in terms of connectivity as we have no internet for the computers allocated to us. Last but not least, we managed to install TPTP, a profiling tool for Java which runs within Eclipse. This Milestone was really dedicated to exploring what our options are and setting up the workspace with the tools that were provided to us. We have also switched Management from Richard to Carl. Second in command will remain Leveda.
